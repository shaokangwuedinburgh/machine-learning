# Data Mining and Exploration

This repository contains the computer labs for the [University of
Edinburgh](http://www.ed.ac.uk/) [School of
Informatics](http://www.ed.ac.uk/informatics/) course Data Mining and
Exploration [INFR11007].

## Labs general information

In this course we will be using Python 3 and the interactive notebook
application [Jupyter](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/) for all
labs. Basic knowledge of `python`, `numpy` and working with
`notebooks` in the Jupyter environment is assumed for this course. If
you haven't used python before, you are strongly advised to
familiarise yourself with basic python syntax and working in the
Jupyter environment. There are many excellent tutorials available on
the web and you can choose the ones you like the most. If you are not
sure which ones to choose, any of these are good starting points:

[Introduction to Python for scientific computing](http://bebi103.caltech.edu/2015/tutorials/t1a_intro_to_python.html)

[Introduction to Jupyter notebooks](http://bebi103.caltech.edu/2015/tutorials/t0b_intro_to_jupyter_notebooks.html)

[Python/Numpy tutorial](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/#python)

[Numpy quickstart guide](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/quickstart.html)

[Scipy Lecture notes](https://scipy-lectures.org/) Section 1 is enough to get you started.

[Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/index.html) Note that some code in the later section is not compatible with the latest scikit-learn version.

The following book is a good introduction to programming in python:
[A Beginners Guide to Python 3 Programming](https://discovered.ed.ac.uk/permalink/f/1njkql8/44UOE_ALMA51223030140002466)


## Packages 

The main **packages** that we will use are the following:
* [numpy:](http://www.numpy.org/) scientific computing by using array objects

* [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/): data structures and data analysis tools

* [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/): machine learning library implementing many learning algorithms and useful tools

* [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/): plotting library (similar to MATLAB's plot interface)

* [seaborn](https://seaborn.github.io/index.html): data visualisation library which works on top of matplotlib

## Getting set up
Python and the scientific libraries needed in labs are installed on
the Informatics DICE system. Note that _virtual_ DICE has not all
packages installed. Please [login
remotely](http://computing.help.inf.ed.ac.uk/new-taught-students) to a
DICE computer instead. In case of problems, please get in touch with
the [Informatics computing
support](http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/systems/support/form/). 

If you prefer to work on your own machine, we recommend using the
[Anaconda distribution](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/). You
should install Python 3 and at least the above packages.

On DICE, the following versions are installed (12 January 2021):

* numpy:          1.17.4

* pandas:          0.25.3

* sci-kit learn:   0.22.2.post1

* matplotlib:     3.1.2

* seaborn:         0.10.0

We recommend to use the same versions on your own machine.

You may like to install some of the jupyter extensions listed
[here](https://towardsdatascience.com/jupyter-notebook-extensions-517fa69d2231),
e.g. the support for collapsible headings, and table of contents.

## History
The original 2017 version is due to Agamemnon Krasoulis, which was
further refined by Maria Astefanoaei, Miruna Clinciu and Arno
Onken. The latest edit is by Michael Gutmann (December 2020 to January
2021). The labs were streamlined, the code simplified and its clarity
improved, and made compatible with Python 3.8.
